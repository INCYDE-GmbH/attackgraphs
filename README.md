# Security Requirements Forecast and Evaluation of Possible Security Concepts – Attack Graphs

This repository contains attack graphs for the 21 use cases identified in the project "Security Requirements Forecast and Evaluation of Possible Security Concepts" (German title: "Prognose Securitybedarf und Bewertung möglicher Sicherheitskonzepte").
The use cases are describe in the report available here: [Report] (German only).
As the research project's language was Germen, the original attack graphs were written in German (see folder `DE/`).
We provide an English translation of the attack graphs in the folder `EN/`.
The methodology to derive the attack graphs published in this repository will be publicly available after completion of the research project in December 2023.
Also, this repository will experience updates while the project proceeds.

## Update

The attack graphs have been updated to reflect the state at the end of the project.
Attribute values were assigned to the attack steps to evaluate the risk and countermeasures were added to identify how the risk can be reduced to an acceptable level.

The (German) report will be referenced here once it has been published.
